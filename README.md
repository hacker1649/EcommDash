## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
- Install a local server such as XAMPP or WAMP.

    ```

2. Move the project to your server directory e.g. for XAMPP, move to `htdocs/` and for WAMP move to `www/`.

3. Before running the project, make sure that you have a valid database connection file.

```bash
<?php

// Database connection details
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "db_sneat_users";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

?>
```

4. Move the EcommDash folder to the htdocs directory (if using XAMPP) or www directory (if using WAMP).
